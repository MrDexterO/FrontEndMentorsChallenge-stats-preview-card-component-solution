## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned a lot from this challenge. From how I need to be extra careful when writing my markups, as one comma or semi colon can throw a whole project off balance, to why it is importance to have a "mobile-first" mindset when designing a website due to responsiveness.

The first issue was a tiny orphan semi-colon that made most of my codes not responding. Inspections could not save me as it identified nothing. Until an act of GOD that drew my attention to that matter. ![](./solutions/error-1.png) 

Other lessons are as follows:
1. Inline elements will never respond to padding unless the display property is changed from `block`, `inline-block` or `inline-flex`

2. The importance of `flex-grow` and `flex-basis` in using `flex`.

3. The flexibility of `grid` when compared to flex for responsiveness.

### Continued development

In future projects, I will continue to work on mastering the flex-grow and flex-basis properties and also put more effort into `grid`..
